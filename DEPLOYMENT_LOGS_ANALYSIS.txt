DEPLOYMENT LOGS ANALYSIS - Dec 23, 11:13 PM EST

CRITICAL FINDING:
The app successfully initializes and connects to PostgreSQL:
✓ PostgreSQL database connection initialized
  Host: dpg-d55l1k1uk2gs73c0u9tg-a.oregon-postgres.render.com
  Database: conductor_db_1dlb
  User: conductor_db_1dlb_user

All workers start successfully:
✓ Feasibility worker started
✓ Planning worker started
✓ Execution worker started

BUT when the API is called to create an idea, the connection fails:
✗ Error creating idea: Error: Connection terminated unexpectedly
  at /opt/render/project/src/node_modules/pg-pool/index.js:45:11

ANALYSIS:
The issue is that the connection pool is being created at startup and verified, but when an actual query is executed (during the API request), the connection is being terminated unexpectedly. This could be due to:

1. SSL/TLS certificate validation issues
2. Network timeout or firewall rules
3. Connection pool configuration issue
4. Database credentials being wrong despite successful initial connection

NEXT STEPS:
1. Add SSL configuration to the pg Pool in db.js
2. Check if the password contains special characters that need escaping
3. Verify the database is actually accepting connections from Render's IP
4. Add connection pool logging to debug the actual error

The logs show the app is live and running, but the database operations are failing.
