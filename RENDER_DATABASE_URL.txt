DATABASE_URL from Render Environment Variables
==============================================

The value shown in the Render dashboard (truncated):
postgresql://conductor_db_1dlb_user:RBqhVU1V9OMFctQfM7ypfT1UDy8y5pcdsqp-d551k1Guk2gs73c0u9tg-a.oregon-postgres.render.com/conductor_db_1dlb

This is the correct external database URL from the Render PostgreSQL database dashboard.

The issue with the parsing error is that my manual parser in db.js is trying to split on "@" but the password contains special characters that might be interfering.

The fix: Instead of manually parsing, use the URL directly with the pg library's built-in URL parser, or use individual connection parameters extracted from the URL.
